# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview
Martha and I believe that cryptocurrencies can change the world, and we want to be part of it. In this project, I am going to help Martha to pitch an investment in cryptocurrency to her firm Accountibility accounting. Bitcoin had become so popular that its price jumped so high for new investors to afford it. But there are many more cryptocurrencies available at more affordable prices. My job is to help Martha to analyze the data set of cryptocurrencies and discover trends that will convince her firm to invest in these new, more affordable cryptocurrencies. 

We will use the raw data downloaded from the internet, and do the following steps to clean, process, and analyze the data.

- Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Summary
- We can divide all the cryptocurrencies into four groups. However, the PCA explained variance ratio showed that for three principle components, it could only cover less than 10% of the features of these data. Therefore, this analysis is not complicated enough to provide much precise insight but only a reference. The recommendation is to pick one or two kinds of coins from each of the four groups for further analysis and investment investigation.
